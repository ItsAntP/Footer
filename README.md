# Medicinal Foods - React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started
### Windows Users
I recommend downloading [cmder](http://cmder.net/). It's a bash emulator so you can easily follow along with terminal commands, like apple/linux users.

### NPM
please install the latest version of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Git
The project repo is on Bitbucket. Go to the project folder, "react_test", and create a Fork of the project.
To create a Fork, click the + sign on the left side bar of the screen.
This will open your copy of the repo. Follow the instructions to "git clone" your repo
to your local computer. <br>
Make commits often!
<br>
Push your commits to your bitbucket repo and then Create A Pull Request from the side bar again. 
Please make your PR's to the relevant feature branch or development branch. Never the Master branch!

## Available Scripts

### `npm i`
Once you have cloned the repo, you'll need to install all the dependencies for the project.<br>
Run this command to get started.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
